Single Cell Data Analysis Workflow: Steps, Codes, and Resources
Single-cell data analysis is a powerful approach for delving into cellular heterogeneity and unlocking hidden biological insights. Here's a comprehensive overview of the workflow, including steps, code snippets, databases, and data formats:
1. Data Acquisition:
Databases:
Public repositories: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), Single Cell Portal (SCP), Tabula Sapiens
Platforms: 10x Genomics, DropSeq, Smart-seq2
Data formats:
FASTQ: Raw sequencing reads
Cell Ranger output: Count matrices, gene-cell expression matrices, metadata files
HDF5/h5ad: Compressed data format for count matrices and annotations
2. Preprocessing:
Quality control: Assess cell viability, gene expression distribution, doublet detection, and library size normalization.

Python
import scanpy as sc
sc.read('matrix.h5ad')
sc.pp.filter_cells(min_counts=1000, max_counts=20000)
sc.pp.normalize_total(target_sum=10000)


Data normalization: Correct for technical biases like batch effects and unwanted variation.

Python
sc.pp.log1p()
sc.pp.combat()


Dimensionality reduction: Reduce data complexity while retaining key information for visualization and analysis.

Python
sc.pp.pca(n_comps=50)
sc.pp.tsne()


3. Cell Clustering and Annotation:
Clustering: Identify groups of cells with similar gene expression patterns.

Python
sc.tl.cluster(sc.obsm['X_tsne'], key='louvain')


Cell type annotation: Assign cell identities based on known marker genes or reference datasets.

Python
sc.tl.annotate(sc.pa.DEGs(groupby='louvain'))
sc.read_harmony_dataset('human_pancreas.h5ad')
sc.integrate_to_reference('human_pancreas')
sc.obsm['louvain_harmony'] = sc.reference_harmonized.obsm['louvain']


4. Differential Expression Analysis:
Identify genes differentially expressed between cell clusters or conditions.

Python
de_genes = sc.tl.differential_expression(groupby='louvain', test='wilcoxon')
sc.plotting.dotplot(de_genes, color=['red', 'green'])


5. Visualization and Interpretation:
Use various plots and interactive tools to explore cell relationships, gene expression patterns, and biological insights.

Python
sc.pl.scatter(sc.obsm['X_tsne'], color='louvain', title='Cell Clusters')
sc.pl.umap(sc.obsm['X_umap'], color='DE_genes', title='Differentially Expressed Genes')
sc.open_browser()  # Open interactive cell browser
